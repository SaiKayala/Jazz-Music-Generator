# Jazz-Music-Generator

## Context
A jazz music generator using Bi-directional LSTM networks.

## Description

The python notebook Music Generation.ipynb contains code to __read all notes from midi files__ , __create a training data set__, __train a Bi-directional LSTM model__ , __generate a new MIDI file__ .

## Dataset

All you need is few MIDI files for the type of music you want to generate

Alternate ways are to download a csv file with notes already extracted for training. For csv click this [link](https://github.com/SaiKayala/Jazz-Ml-Dataset)

You can also create your own csv using notebook in this [link](https://github.com/SaiKayala/MIDI-2-CSV)

## Acknowledgements
The midi files used are from free MIDI websites like https://freemidi.org/ and all the other columns are formed by extracting features from those MIDI files.
